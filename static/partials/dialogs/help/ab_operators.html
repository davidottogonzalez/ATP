        This is the lists of operators one can use in an attribute expression. There are 3 types of operators here. First,
        there are the boolean operators (AND and OR). These operators are used as conjunctions to combine comparisons in a
        search. Second, there is the parentheses operator. This is used to grow the expression if one operator and two
        operands are not enough. Third, there are the comparison operators (>=, <=, ==, <>, and REGEX). These operators
        allow comparisons between two values. Two comparison operators that may not be intuitive are the <> and REGEX
        operators. The "<>" operator means not equal to so you can query whether two values are not equal. The REGEX
        (regular expression) is a little more complicated operator. It is used to find patterns in a string to quickly find
        matches. For example, if one wants to check if a zip code contains a non-numeric character, we can use the following
        expression: F004 REGEX '[^0-9]'. This expression will look at the values in the F004 column and run the pattern
        across the value and return true or false depending if there is a match.
