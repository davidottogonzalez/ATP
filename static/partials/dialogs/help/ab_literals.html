        This is the area where one can add literal strings to the attribute expression. These literals are used to be
        operands that express an actual value. For example in the expression F004 == '11106', the '11106' is the literal
        because it is the actual value that we are querying for against the F004 column in the dataset.

        Another thing to note is that the literals can be surronded (or not) by quotations (e.g. 11 vs '11'). When comparing
        to a column that contains numeric values, like number of people in a household, the literal for the expression should
        not contain quotes. For every other type of value, the literal should be surrounded by quotes.

        To add literals that can be dragged and dropped into the expression, one needs to type out the literal and click 'Add'.
